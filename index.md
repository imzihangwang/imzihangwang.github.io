## About Me

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University working with Professor [Benjamin B. Risk](https://github.com/thebrisklab). I received my master's degree in Statistics from University of Wisconsin-Madison and bachelor's degree in Statistics from Nankai University in China. My research interests center around developing statistical methods and computational tools to analyze complex biomedical (neuroimaging/genetics) data.

My name in Chinese is 王子航.

## Education
- M.S. in Statistics: Data Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2021
- B.S. in Statistics, Nankai University, 2020

## Research Interests

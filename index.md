I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University working with Professor [Benjamin B. Risk](https://github.com/thebrisklab). I received M.S. in Statistics from UW-Madison and B.S. in Statistics from Nankai University in China.
